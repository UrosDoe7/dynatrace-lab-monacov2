#  Lab - onboard your application with Monaco

In this lab, you will automatically deploy the smart configuration for easytravel with Monaco (Monitoring as Code)   
Monaco is a small executable which can be installed on your laptop, on an activegate, on a container, on a jumbobox...   
Monaco will interact with your tenant Dynatrace thanks to the API token.  
For a simplification of this Lab, we will install Monaco on the monitored VM, BUT you never do that on the real life.     
In this lab we only use the monaco version **NEW_CLI=1** (the future of monaco)
